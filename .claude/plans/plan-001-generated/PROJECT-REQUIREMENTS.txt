INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Please analyze the requirements above and create a comprehensive project plan.

1. Read the PLAN-SCHEMA.json to understand the plan structure
2. Read the PROJECT-PLAN-TEMPLATE.json for the format
3. Create a PROJECT-PLAN.json file in this directory with:
   - Clear project/subproject/milestone hierarchy
   - Detailed tasks with IDs (TASK-001, TASK-002, etc.)
   - Proper dependencies between tasks
   - Realistic time estimates
   - Phases: design, implementation, testing, deployment
   - Completion criteria for each task

4. Structure the plan to follow these phases:
   - DESIGN: Architecture, UI/UX, database schema
   - IMPLEMENTATION: Core features, API, frontend
   - TESTING: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
   - DEPLOYMENT: Build, CI/CD, documentation

5. Ensure tasks are:
   - Granular (2-8 hours each)
   - Clearly defined with specific deliverables
   - Properly sequenced with dependencies
   - Grouped logically by feature/component

6. After creating the plan, present a summary showing:
   - Total tasks and estimated hours
   - Project structure (projects → subprojects → milestones → tasks)
   - Critical path and dependencies
   - Recommended starting tasks

Once you've reviewed this file and created the plan, tell the user to run:
  npm run plan:init

This will lock the plan and generate the task tracker.
